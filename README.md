Active Directory in VM

I set up an active directory in my pc. I downloaded the windows server 2022 which will be used as a domain controller. I didnt have windows license, so i continued without the license and it allowed me to keep the server for 60 days and I also downloaded the windows 11 to be used a user for the AD. Windows 11 took forever to install, so i downloaded .iso file of windows 10 instead.

I have taken screenshots of every steps from the installation to setting a wallpaper with Group Policy Management Feature. This is a small demonstration to keep track for myself incase I forget this in the future. There are some steps where I was stuck, I will mention those as well.

Note: Proceed with Un-attended installation is required if you dont want to sit and wait for the VM to be installed.

The Un Attended installation will ask too many questions like inputting product key. It also gives and option to install < Emphasize guest edition here> guest edition. This allows the full screen view after the OS is installed in VM. 

I chose the memory and space. It depends on the size of ram and space in the host machine. More ram means more faster and smooth os in the vm.
